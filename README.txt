Just a fun little evening exercise, when I tried to derive Keppler's Laws from Newton's Principles.
The second one is fairly easy to do analytically, the first one not so much, so I opted for a graph.
The data were created in a program written in Jonathan Blows Jai language. The plotting was done in
R ggplot2.
